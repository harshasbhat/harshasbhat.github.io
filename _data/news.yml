    - hl: "Tsunami Induced By Supershear Earthquakes"
      txt: "How can strike-slip earthquakes generate devastating tsunamis? We
address this question by showing that if an earthquake rupture attains
supershear speed then the shock fronts of this rupture can easily
trigger a tsunami."
      closing: "This work will appear soon in Nature Geoscience."
