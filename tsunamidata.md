<h3 align="center">Supershear Tsunami: DATA</h3>


The PALP GPS station data, in MATLAB format, can be downloaded [here][tsunamidata1]. The MATLAB structure PALP has time, North, East, Vertical components of the data.
In addition we provide the fault parallel, vp, and fault normal, vn, velocity components. The duration of the earthquake in the time array is from 0 to 35 secs.

The Pantoloan tidal gauge data can be downloaded [here][tsunamidata2].
<br><br>
The numerical simulation data for tsunami generation can be downloaded [here][tsunamidata4].
<br><br>
We developed a novel solver for the shallow water wave equation using the Fourier Continuation Method. We are in the process of publishing the algorithm and making the code public.
In the mean time interested parties may contact the corresponding author of the paper.
