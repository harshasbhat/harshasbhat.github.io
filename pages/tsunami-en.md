<h3 align="left">Abstract</h3>
<p><b>Hazardous tsunamis are known to be generated predominantly at subduction zones by large earthquakes on dip (vertical)-slip faults.
However, a moment magnitude, $M_w$, 7.5 earthquake on a strike (lateral)-slip fault in Sulawesi (Indonesia) in 2018 generated a tsunami that devastated the city of Palu.
The mechanism by which this large tsunami originated from a strike-slip earthquake has been debated.

Here we present near-field ground motion data from a GPS station that confirms that the 2018 Palu earthquake attained supershear speed, i.e., a rupture speed greater 
than the speed of shear waves in the host medium. We study the effect of this supershear rupture on tsunami generation by coupling the ground motion to a 1D non-linear 
shallow-water wave model that accounts for both the time-dependent bathymetric displacement and velocity. With the local bathymetric profile of the Palu bay around a tidal gauge, 
we find that these simulations reproduce the tsunami motions measured by the gauge, with only minimal tuning of parameters. 

We conclude that Mach (shock) fronts, generated by the supershear speed of the earthquake, interacted with the bathymetry and contributed to the tsunami. 
This suggests that rupture speed should be considered in tsunami hazard assessments.</b></p>

      The magnitude, $M_w$, 7.5 Palu Sulawesi earthquake struck on 28 September 2018 causing wide spread destruction and loss of lives$^2$ occurred on a strike (lateral)-slip fault in Sulawesi (Indonesia). This earthquake also generated a tsunami 
      that devastated the city of Palu. As such strike-slip earthquakes do not involve large vertical movements (compared to the one in Tohoku, Japan during the 2011 earthquake) the cause of this
      tsunami has been a mystery.

    <div class="cardtxt"> 
      As an earthquake starts unzipping a fault, the front of the earthquake (the zipper) constantly emits Pressure-waves and Shear-waves into the medium. P-waves
      travel at a speed of about 5 km/s (18000 km/hr) and S-waves at about 3.5 km/s (12600 km/hr). For typical earthquakes the speed of the
      front is slower than the S-waves. They are called subshear earthquakes.<br><br>
      
      For Supershear earthquakes, on the other hand, the earthquake front travels faster than the Shear-waves. As the S-wave speed
      barrier is broken linear shock fronts manifest themselves. These are exactly akin to the sonic boom we hear from supersonic aircrafts.

    <div class="cardtxt"> 
      Supershear earthquakes have unique ground motion signature. The way the ground moves parallel and perpendicular to the fault 
      tells us about how fast the earthquake front moved. We showed that to best explain the recorded ground motion at the PALP GPS station
      the earthquake had to go supershear. This is an indubitable proof of the speed of the earthquake. <br><br>
      
      Incidentally, this is the first time a Supershear earthquake was detected using a GPS station.

      Classical Tsunamis are generated by the large vertical displacement of the sea floor around the fault. Subduction Zone earthquakes are
      typical sources of such tsunamis. Strike-Slip earthquakes, on the other hand, do not displace the ocean-bottom so much.

      Supershear ruptures manifest shock fronts. These shock fronts carry energy from the fault to large distances without much loss.
      In this work here we show that even if the displacements are small, the very fact that the shock fronts affect a large region is sufficient
      to generate a tsunami. In Palu bay, the bathtub like bathymetry further helped this tsunami become quite large.
