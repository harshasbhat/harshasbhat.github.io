<div class="panel">
<p><b>Hazardous tsunamis are known to be generated predominantly at
subduction zones by large earthquakes on dip (vertical)-slip faults.
However, a moment magnitude, $M_w$, 7.5 earthquake on a strike
(lateral)-slip fault in Sulawesi (Indonesia) in 2018 generated a tsunami
that devastated the city of Palu. The mechanism by which this large
tsunami originated from a strike-slip earthquake has been debated.

Here we present near-field ground motion data from a GPS station that
confirms that the 2018 Palu earthquake attained supershear speed, i.e.,
a rupture speed greater than the speed of shear waves in the host
medium. We study the effect of this supershear rupture on tsunami
generation by coupling the ground motion to a 1D non-linear
shallow-water wave model that accounts for both the time-dependent
bathymetric displacement and velocity. With the local bathymetric
profile of the Palu bay around a tidal gauge, we find that these
simulations reproduce the tsunami motions measured by the gauge, with
only minimal tuning of parameters.

We conclude that Mach (shock) fronts, generated by the supershear speed
of the earthquake, interacted with the bathymetry and contributed to the
tsunami. This suggests that rupture speed should be considered in
tsunami hazard assessments.</b></p>

<h3 align="left" id="one">1. The Earthquake</h3>

The magnitude, $M_w$, 7.5 Palu Sulawesi earthquake struck on 28
September 2018 causing wide spread destruction and loss of lives$^2$
occurred on a strike (lateral)-slip fault in Sulawesi (Indonesia). This
earthquake also generated a tsunami that devastated the city of Palu. As
such strike-slip earthquakes do not involve large vertical movements
(compared to the one in Tohoku, Japan during the 2011 earthquake) the
cause of this tsunami has been a mystery.  

<h4 align="center">However, this was a "Supershear" Earthquake</h4>    

<h3 align="left" id="two">2. Supershear Earthquakes</h3>

{% include video.html id="hMHSsEobbz0"%}

<br><br>

As an earthquake starts unzipping a fault, the front of the earthquake
(the zipper) constantly emits Pressure-waves and Shear-waves into the
medium. P-waves travel at a speed of about 5 km/s (18000 km/hr) and
S-waves at about 3.5 km/s (12600 km/hr). For typical earthquakes the
speed of the front is slower than the S-waves. They are called subshear
earthquakes.<br><br>

For Supershear earthquakes, on the other hand, the earthquake front
travels faster than the Shear-waves. As the S-wave speed barrier is
broken linear shock fronts manifest themselves. These are exactly akin
to the sonic boom we hear from supersonic aircrafts. 
    

<h3 align="left" id="three">3. The Evidence</h3>

{% include image.html url="/images/tsunami/GPS.png" 
caption="Ground Velocity recorded by the PALP GPS station." width="100%" align="center" %}

<br><br>

Supershear earthquakes have unique ground motion signature. The way
the ground moves parallel and perpendicular to the fault tells us
about how fast the earthquake front moved. We showed that to best
explain the recorded ground motion at the PALP GPS station the
earthquake had to go supershear. This is an indubitable proof of the
speed of the earthquake. <br><br>
  
Incidentally, this is the first time a Supershear earthquake was
detected using a GPS station.

<h3 align="left"  id="four">4. Classical Tsunami Generation</h3>

{% include video.html id="4Xebwzb3dDE?start=12" caption="Classical Tsunami Generation. Courtesy: Caltech Tectonics Observatory"%}


Classical Tsunamis are generated by the large vertical displacement of
the sea floor around the fault. Subduction Zone earthquakes are
typical sources of such tsunamis. Strike-Slip earthquakes, on the
other hand, do not displace the ocean-bottom so much.

<h4 align="center">Except when they are "Supershear" Earthquakes</h4>

<br>

Supershear ruptures manifest shock fronts. These shock fronts carry
energy from the fault to large distances without much loss. In this
work here we show that even if the displacements are small, the very
fact that the shock fronts affect a large region is sufficient to
generate a tsunami. In Palu bay, the bathtub like bathymetry further
helped this tsunami become quite large.
