<hr>

The <a href="https://www.ratp.fr/en/">Paris Metro Website</a> is excellent to 
get transportation options to reach ENS.
<br><br>

To reach my office take the elevators marked A, B or C in the plan below. Press 4 if you take 
elevator A. Press 2 if you take elevators B or C. <i>There is an ongoing 
international manhunt for the genius who designed this mess</i>. <br><br>

I am in room E203 pointed by the arrow below. <br><br>

<i>If you are surrounded by
ugly orange walls you are almost there. We are actively looking for the 
idiot who picked this color.</i>
