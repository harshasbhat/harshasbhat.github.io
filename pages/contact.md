The <a href="https://www.ratp.fr/en/">Paris Metro Website</a> is excellent to 
get transportation options to reach ENS (24 rue Lhomond, red dot above). To reach my office take the elevator marked C or D to the 2nd floor in the plan above. I am in room E208 (green dot above). 

When you see a long orange corridor take it. There is an international manhunt for the person who picked this color. But keep walking into the blinding orange light. Eventually you will hit a fork. And as Yogi Berra says, 'just take it'.
